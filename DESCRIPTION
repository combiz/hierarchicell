Description: The hierarchicell package estimates important parameters from single-cell
    RNA-seq expression counts before simulating expression data that is cell-type 
    specific and hierarchical in nature. With the simulated data, hierarchicell 
    is then able to compute power calculations under a variety of conditions. 
    The package consists of four important categories of functions: data loading 
    and cleaning, empirical estimation of distributions, simulating expression 
    data, and computing power or type 1 error.
