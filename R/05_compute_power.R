#' @description Computes power for single cell data that is cell-type specifc and

#'   effects to account for the correlation structure that exists among measures
#'   from cells within an individual. The power calculations will borrow
#'   information from the input data (or the package default data) to simulate
#'   data under a variety of pre-determined conditions. These conditions include

#'
#' @note Data should be \strong{only for cells of the specific cell-type} you

#'   contain as many unique sample identifiers as possible. If you are inputing
#'   data that has less than 5 unique values for sample identifier (i.e.,
#'   independent experimental units), then the empirical estimation of the
#'   inter-individual heterogeneity is going to be very unstable. Finding such a

#'
#'@param data_summaries an R object that has been output by the package's
#'  compute_data_summaries function. No default
#'
#'@param n_genes an integer. The number of genes you would like to simulate for
#'  your dataset. Too large of a number may cause memory failure and may slow
#'  the simulation down tremendously. We recommend an integer less than 40,000.
#'  Defaults to 10,000.
#'
#'@param n_per_group an integer. The number of independent samples per
#'  case/control group for simulation. Creates a balanced design, for unbalanced
#'  designs, specify n_cases and n_controls separately. If not specifying a
#'  foldchange, the number of cases and controls does not matter. Defaults to 3.
#'
#'@param n_cases an integer. The number of independent control samples for
#'  simulation. Defaults to n_per_group.
#'
#'@param n_controls an integer. The number of independent case samples for
#'  simulation. Defaults to n_per_group.
#'
#'@param cells_per_control an integer. The mean number of cells per control you
#'  would like to simulate. Too large of a number may cause memory failure and
#'  may slow the simulation down tremendously. We recommend an integer less than
#'  300, but more is possible. We note that anything greater than 100, brings
#'  marginal improvements in power. Defaults to 100.
#'
#'@param cells_per_case an integer. The mean number of cells per case you would
#'  like to simulate. Too large of a number may cause memory failure and may
#'  slow the simulation down tremendously. We recommend an integer less than
#'  300, but more is possible. We note that anything greater than 100, brings
#'  marginal improvements in power. Defaults to 100.
#'
#'@param ncells_variation_type either "Poisson", "NB", or "Fixed". Allows the
#'  number of cells per individual to be fixed at exactly the specified number
#'  of cells per individual, vary slightly with a poisson distribution with a
#'  lambda equal to the specified number of cells per individual, or a negative
#'  binomial with a mean equal to the specified number of cells and dispersion
#'  size equal to one.Defaults to "Poisson".
#'
#'@param pval a number. The significance threshold (alpha) to use for
#'  significance. Defaults to 0.05. Can also be a vector of pvalue - up to a
#'  length of 5.
#'
#'@param foldchange a number between 1 and 10. The amount of fold change to
#'  simulate a difference in expression between case and control groups. The
#'  foldchange changes genes in either direction, so a foldchange of 2  would
#'  cause the mean expression in cases to be either twice the amount or half the
#'  amount for any particular gene. Defaults to 1.
#'
#'@param decrease_dropout a numeric proportion between 0 and 1. The proportion
#'  by which you would like to simulate decreasing the amount of dropout in your
#'  data. For example, if you would like to simulate a decrease in the amount of
#'  dropout in your data by twenty percent, then 0.2 would be appropriate. This
#'  component of the simulation allows the user to adjust the proportion of
#'  dropout if they believe future experiments or runs will have improved
#'  calling rates (due to improved methods or improved cell viability) and
#'  thereby lower dropout rates. Defaults to 0.
#'
#'@param alter_dropout_cases a numeric proportion between 0 and 1. The
#'  proportion by which you would like to simulate decreasing the amount of
#'  dropout between case control groups. For example, if you would like to
#'  simulate a decrease in the amount of dropout in your cases by twenty
#'  percent, then 0.2 would be appropriate. This component of the simulation
#'  allows the user to adjust the proportion of dropout if they believe the
#'  stochastic expression of a gene will differ between cases and controls. For
#'  a two-part hurdle model, like MAST implements, this will increase your
#'  ability to detect differences. Defaults to 0.
#'
#'@return The estimated power under the specified conditions when using random
#'  effects to account for the correlation structure that exists among measures
#'  from cells within an individual.

#'  for the correlation structure that exists among measures from cells within
#'  an individual. The power calculations will borrow information from the input
#'  data (or the package default data) to simulate data under a variety of
#'  pre-determined conditions. These conditions include the mean and standard
#'  deviation of the continuous measure of interest, number of genes, number of
#'  samples (i.e., independent experimental units), correlation between the
#'  outcome and fold change, and the mean number of cells per individual.
#'
#'@details Prior to running the \code{\link{power_hierarchicell}} function, it
#'  is important to run the \code{\link{filter_counts}} function followed by the
#'  \code{\link{compute_data_summaries}} function to build an R object that is
#'  in the right format for the following simulation function to properly work.
#'
#'@note Data should be \strong{only for cells of the specific cell-type} you are
#'  interested in simulating or computing power for. Data should also contain as
#'  many unique sample identifiers as possible. If you are inputing data that
#'  has less than 5 unique values for sample identifier (i.e., independent
#'  experimental units), then the empirical estimation of the inter-individual
#'  heterogeneity is going to be very unstable. Finding such a dataset will be
#'  difficult at this time, but, over time (as experiments grow in sample size
#'  and the numbers of publically available single-cell RNAseq datasets
#'  increase), this should improve dramatically.
#'
#'@param data_summaries an R object that has been output by the package's
#'  compute_data_summaries function. No default
#'
#'@param n_genes an integer. The number of genes you would like to simulate for
#'  your dataset. Too large of a number may cause memory failure and may slow
#'  the simulation down tremendously. We recommend an integer less than 40,000.
#'  Defaults to 10,000.
#'
#'@param n_individuals an integer. The number of independent samples for
#'  simulation. If not specifying a foldchange, the number of cases and controls
#'  does not matter. Defaults to 3.
#'
#'@param cells_per_individual an integer. The mean number of cells per control
#'  you would like to simulate. Too large of a number may cause memory failure
#'  and may slow the simulation down tremendously. We recommend an integer less
#'  than 300, but more is possible. We note that anything greater than 100,
#'  brings marginal improvements in power. Defaults to 100.
#'
#'@param ncells_variation_type either "Poisson", "NB", or "Fixed". Allows the
#'  number of cells per individual to be fixed at exactly the specified number
#'  of cells per individual, vary slightly with a poisson distribution with a
#'  lambda equal to the specified number of cells per individual, or a negative
#'  binomial with a mean equal to the specified number of cells and dispersion
#'  size equal to one.Defaults to "Poisson".
#'
#'@param pval a number. The significance threshold (alpha) to use for
#'  significance. Defaults to 0.05. Can also be a vector of pvalue - up to a
#'  length of 5.
#'
#'@param rho a number between -1 and 1. The amount of correlation between fold
#'  change and the continuous measure of interest.Defaults to 1.
#'
#'@param continuous_mean A number. The mean for your continuous measure of
#'  interest. Assumes a normal distribution.Defaults to 0.
#'
#'@param continuous_sd A number. The standard deviation for your continuous
#'  measure of interest. Assumes a normal distribution.Defaults to 1.
#'
#'@param decrease_dropout a numeric proportion between 0 and 1. The proportion
#'  by which you would like to simulate decreasing the amount of dropout in your
#'  data. For example, if you would like to simulate a decrease in the amount of
#'  dropout in your data by twenty percent, then 0.2 would be appropriate. This
#'  component of the simulation allows the user to adjust the proportion of
#'  dropout if they believe future experiments or runs will have improved
#'  calling rates (due to improved methods or improved cell viability) and
#'  thereby lower dropout rates. Defaults to 0.
#'
#'
#'@return The estimated power under the specified conditions when using random
#'  effects to account for the correlation structure that exists among measures
#'  from cells within an individual.
